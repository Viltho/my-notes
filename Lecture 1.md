## Introduction


Hello and Good day,
<br>
my name is abdullah abu hamad,
I am an IT/data driven enthusiast seeking career development opportunities in many scientific and technologoical sectors for my own career shift, i was influenced to learn more about python from previous cohorts and camps by my friends colleagues and relatives that work and have an impact in this department and know how important it is to take part in the IT sector in accordance to the current market need.
<br>Favorite food is shoshbarak and maglobeh.
<br>Fun fact: I am a gamer, i love to draw, and mainly music influenced, no music though.


## What I learned in our first lecutre in DigiSkills

**Lecture 1** - 29/01/2023 Sunday, *Software Development - Python*
GUI - Graphical user interface - interactive
CLI - Command line interface - text based

GUI:
- Easy to use
- User friendly -buttons -icons -colors

CLI:
- Hard to master command lines
- Multitasking



> Ubuntu codes: [Link](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-the-command-line/modules/learn-the-command-line-navigation/cheatsheet).
- pwd - print working directory -> press enter to know where you want

- cd - change directory -> cd Desktop(if you press Tab it autocompletes with /)
	1. cd .. >> cd ../.. Go back one step or two steps
	2. cd / > to go back to root
	3. cd . > current directory
- cdwr - change directory to linux main

- mkdir - make directory > can work with > mkdir [name1] [name2]

- ls - list files and/or folders in directory
	-a all files

- touch - create a File.[ext] > i.e. Text.txt
	touch (.)[name].[ext] > (.) = hidden

- rm - remove file

- rmdir - remove directory
	-rf recursively forced

- code . - to open Visual Studio


VCS - Version control system - most common vcs is Git
- team working/collaboration 
- backup and recovery
- tracking changes
- branching and merging
- auditing for code

<br>
 Sequel Ubuntu codes:

> git - git vcs function
-	init > to initialize git in current directory
-	status > to track any changes
	1. untracked
	2. staged
	3. committed
-	add > to start tracking a file
		. to add all you should add a dot after ‘add’
-	clone > to download the repository from GitHub
		clone [SSH code]
-	commit > to assign it to user
		-m ‘[message]‘ > to add message in between ‘ ’
-	push origin main

**important** to follow up with changes:
> Create mode xxxxxx [name].[ext] > xxxxxx = change/edit to file tracking number.

Always do:
> git add .

> git commit -m ‘[message]’

> git push origin main

To add, commit, and push files.
