**Lecture 2** - 30/01/2023 Monday, *Software Development - Python*
<br>In this lecture we took:
- GitHub Branches 
- Conflicts and how to solve them
- Wireframing

Branches envelopes your work from a repository to work on specific features isolated from other branches.

By default the first branch to work on is called main.


Hierarchy diagram from website to other parts to other features.

How to ?

1. Create a repository (main)
2. Create new branches
3. Work on my own branch - ACP
4. Pull request (merge code with main branch)


Ubuntu codes:
>git branch [nameofnewbranch] - create new branch

>git push origin [nameonewfbranch] - push to a specific branch (previously main)

>git checkout [nameonewfbranch] - to assign current work branch

>git pull origin [nameonewfbranch] - to update your local version with the version of the newly updated branch

Do a quick **A C P** afterwards.

Github allows you to compare and pull when a new push is done after changes from any new branch.
Bare in mind that there is not a tree to follow up with the branches, so you need to clarify the content of the branch by the name of the branch and the commits.

**Conflicts:**
<br>Can be solved with communication through the code or arrangements.

**Wireframing:**
<br>It is the discussion and initial drawing of the layout of the application, which demonstrates interface elements.
Solved also using communication and agreement on work to be done, and can be done using:
